# 30-days-of-ML
30 days of ML is a Kaggle in class competition which we built regression models to predict and minimize root mean square error       
# Random Forest Regressor Model 
- it's first model we tried 
- we did some feature optimization
- code  
-- import libraries  
-- load the data  
-- prepare the data(Transformation)  
-- getting best n_estimators feature's value  
-- fiting  
-- predict
